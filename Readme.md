## ðŸŽ´ What's the Flappy Bird game
* Flappy Bird is a mobile game developed by Vietnamese video game artist and programmer Dong Nguyen. The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. Nguyen created the game over the period of several days, using a bird protagonist that he had designed for a cancelled game in 2012.
